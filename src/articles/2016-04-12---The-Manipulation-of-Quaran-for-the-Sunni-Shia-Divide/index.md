> Written as an essay for the course HIST 3650 - History of the Middle East at Trent University.

When looking at the sociocultural and political conflicts in countries in the Middle East, 
religion can be used both as a unifying and dividing tool that allows people to gain what they 
desire from wars. The Quran is the holy text which binds Muslims around the world together 
through its message of peace and devotion. However, at the same time, the text of the Quran are 
manipulated by political groups to divide, conquer and incite violence among communities. The 
Sunni vs. Shia divide in Islam is a man-made conflict that is 1,400 years old. At first glance, the 
divide seems to be doctrinal, a part of history written down in stone. In fact, many violent events 
perpetrated against groups of people in the Middle East have been justified and organized under 
the doctrinal beliefs between Sunni Muslims vs. Shia Muslims. This essay intends to argue that 
the Sunni vs. Shia divide is not based on religious doctrines. The divide between Sunni and Shia 
is man-made, where the Quran was used as a divisive tool to gain political and economic power 
over the banner of Islam. The justification of violence through the holy text is important to 
understand, in order to snuff out the political groups who operate solely on greed for power.

The history of the Sunni and Shia divide is stated to have started with the death of 
Muhammad the Prophet in 632AD.1 With the death of the prophet, a power vacuum appeared, in 
which a subsequent successor had to fill in the role of the prophet. Two major groups disagreed 
on the inheritance of that powerful role of the prophet. Sunni Muslims believed that Abu’Bakr is 
the first successor, while Shia Muslims believed it was Hazrat Ali.2 In other words, two groups 
had different criteria on who was meant to be their next leader.  
The divide still exists today. Sunni and Shia Muslims usually attend different mosques, 
with varying styles of worship.3 About 80% of Muslims in the world today claim to be Sunni 
Muslims. However it is important to remember, that claiming to be Muslims does not 
automatically mean they are based on the same doctrines, culture, or political identity. Some 
might identify to be culturally and legally Muslim, but not necessarily identity to be religiously 
Muslim. Muslim-ness plays a role in individual lives in individual ways.  
For Sunni vs. Shia Muslims, a difference in their claim to the “throne” does not 
necessarily divide them to be different. Often times, their religions the God they worship remains 
the same. The political differences in the opinion on the criteria for the next prophet should not 
divide people into two separate religions. However, this very divide between the political 
opinions of Sunni and Shia Muslims have been used to incite and justify violence throughout 
history.  
The conflict between Sunni and Shia are evident throughout the centuries. In India, for 
example, political protests against the Shia government for the right to recite “Madhe-sahiba”

occurred all throughout the 20 century.4  In Iraq at around the same period, anti-Shia sentiments 
brewed among the Iraqi population when governments picked its leaders based on their Shia 
identity.5 These histories of conflict can be found throughout Safavid Empire and onwards.6 
While these conflicts seem to be caused by the opposing identities of Sunni Muslims and Shia 
Muslims, it is important to note they all had one thing in common: It was a struggle for power. In 
India, Sunni Muslims wanted their rights to practice their “Madhe-sahiba”, their own prayer to 
the ancestors as a symbol of their independence from the ruling class. In Iraq, the Shia Muslims 
wished for a democratic elections for equal political voice on the matter. And the conflicts 
throughout the Middle East history between Sunni and Shia throughout the Safavid Empire, was 
about power of the empires vs. many other ruling class. The unfortunate truth is that any groups 
of people in communities struggle for power. For the Sunni vs. Shia divide, people justified this 
very divide in order to gain political power. The issues were always about gaining power, not the 
differences between the two Muslim groups.   
The most recent example of the Sunni vs. Shia divide is the jihad group DEASH (al
Dawla al-Islamiya al-Iraq al-Sham), or ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham). As a terrorist 
group that largely identify as Sunni Muslims, they oppress Shias and any other individual who 
do not follow their beliefs. The DAESH group represents the vital misconduct of interpreting the 
Quran to the reader’s own liking. Many Muslims scholars do not view the group under any 
means to be truly operating on the basis of the holy text, because their systematic rules and 
actions disregard the Quran.

ISIS is the result of American invasion of Iraq in which the foreign power destroyed the 
existing sociopolitical infrastructures within the country. When American forces left Iraq tattered 
and destroyed, they left a power vacuum in the country, which ISIS took through violence and 
terror. Similar to when Muhammed the Prophet passed away in 632AD, when the position for 
power became available for the next successor, power vacuums result in people fighting for 
power based on their greed for power. Nowhere in the texts of tge Quran does it specify who 
should continue on the role after Muhammed’s death. In the Quran, there is no text that 
distinguishes or divides the Muslim people into Sunni or Shia. The Sunni vs. Shia divide is 
purely man-made. In a similar way, jihad terrorist groups like ISIS do not commit their acts of 
violence based on the holy text of the Quran. Their acts of terror are man-made, aimed to gain 
political power. They are formed by militants who have created rules based on their greed for 
power.  
The Quran states: “God does not love corruption”, “God does not love mischief”, “God 
does not love evil doing” “God does not love wrongdoing.”.7 Quran represents the unifying 
object of text that brings Muslims around the world together. Quran represents peace. By the 
standards of the holy text, radical groups like ISIS, and Boko Harem8 do not represent the Islam 
faith. 9 They are man-made organizations seeking to satisfy their own desires through violent 
means, and they goes against the message of Allah.

When analyzing the Sunni vs. Shia divide, a question must be asked for every Muslim 
and historian looking into this subject: Does the Quran specify that Sunni and Shia should be 
divided? Quran is a unifying holy text, not meant to subsidize or destroy or torture or kill 
innocent lives. Mohammad never preached for the divide between Sunni and Shia Muslims. The 
divide is something that is fabricated, made up by mortal beings, not from a divine. Its source is 
man-made greed for power, not god-made doctrinal divide. 
Today many scholars and historians ask: What happened to the Middle East? The Middle 
East’s political and historical identity was shattered, broken through the various power-hungry 
groups that sought to take over its lands and resources. The West and its relationship to the 
people of Islam faith is a complex issue. Despite the unfortunate and sobering history of the 
Middle East, the truth of the matter is that Islam as a faith still thrives today. And by virtue, 
Islam as a faith operates on the contexts of the Quran. “Islam” means peace. The peaceful 
greeting of one Muslim to another is “Saleem”, and that word is derived from the same 
consonantal roots as “Islam” and “Muslim”, all meaning “Peace. Therefore, the Quran as a holy 
text is pivotal idea in the concept of Sunni vs. Shia violence. Such violence should not be 
occurring when the Quran, and Islam as faith promotes peace. 
Sham Murad is a twitter user who created a popular post on the history of the Middle 
East. It is noteworthy to view individual interpretations of the history of the Middle East, 
because they provide a worldview that you will not get in the average Western Media news 
outlet. Her summary is hauntingly bitter (like her twitter name @bitterarab), and it illustrates the 
theme of division that is apparent in the history, which caused so much violence throughout the 
centuries.

Sham @bitterarab  Mar 20 It's been 13 years since the US occupation of Iraq so I'm going to create a timeline of the horrific vile acts committed during their time 9:38 AM - 20 Mar 2016

Sham @bitterarab  Mar 20 the turmoil Iraq was put through when voting for new wars in countries you know NOTHING about. Thanks for reading.  
 
 
Violence incites violence. Division incites further division. Like the message shared by 
Abuelaish, Izzeldin’s daughter Bessan who fell victim to conflict between Palestine and Israel, 
violence is not the answer to peace: “There is more than one way to solve a problem. To meet 
terrorism with terrorism or violence with violence doesn’t solve anything… We think as 
enemies, we live on opposite sides and never meet. But I feel we are all the same. We are all 
9 
 
human beings”10 The violence perpetuated by jihad terrorist groups is purely based on their 
desire to gain more political powers. To achieve peace, one must look to at the fundamental 
message of Islam as a faith. Islam is a religion that advocates peace. Quran is a pillar of the Islam 
faith.  The way to deal with a militant group like ISIS is to de-legitimize their position of power 
by exposing their relationships to the Islam faith as illegitimate, and therefore separate them 
from the Islam faith. Similarly, the way to deal with the Sunni vs. Shia divide, is to expose the 
division to be completely man-made. There is no real doctrinal basis for the divide, and by 
exposing its dissociation from the Quran, the Sunni vs. Shia divide become illegitimate, and 
superficial.  
I understand that my statement that Sunni vs. Shia divide is man-made, is a controversial 
one, where many Mulisms might find it offensive that a non-Muslim is claiming that there are no 
doctrinal basis for the Sunni vs. Shia divide. However, I must state this statement, because the 
conflict and violence that arise from this division must be exposed for what they are. The 
violence perpetuated in the name of Sunni vs. Shia is illegitimate. In order to achieve peace 
between Palestine and Israel, between terrorist groups and innocent victims, between the Middle 
East and the West, and finally between Sunni Muslims vs. Shia Muslims, one must realize that 
the division is illegitimate, and subsequently the violence that ensues from this division should 
cease.  
The Quran is extremely important for the current state and future of Middle East and the 
people in the Islam faith. If Western leaders read the Quran, they would be better equipped to 
deal with tactical responses to the Islamic states or militant radical groups and their wars. While

many wrongly interpret and manipulate the Quran as a divisive tool to incite violence, it is 
pivotal to understand the true message of the holy text.  
The divide within Islam, has started long before the death of Mohammed. It is human 
nature to crave power and to create an “us” vs. “them”. The Shia vs. Sunni conflict is yet another 
fabricated conflict that is used to legitimize so many violent acts today. Therefore, exploring and 
exposing the roots of this conflict to be illegitimate is extremely important in illuminating the 
end to the violence. The holy text Quran, much similar to the Holy Scriptures of Christianity, 
Judaism, and many other religions around the world all promote peace. Humanity is made up of 
humans who strive for individual gains, which is why striving for peace often becomes difficult 
amidst the greed for power. Terror is not only for the West – Terror affects all of us living on the 
same planet, and Muslims and non-Muslims will benefit from the peaceful messages promoted 
through the Quran.  
 
“Enter absolutely into peace (Islam). Do not follow in the footsteps of satan. He is an 
outright enemy to you.”11
