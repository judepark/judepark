> I wrote this essay after a school trip. Reading it reminds me of the sights I saw back then. I must have been no more than 13 years old.

I was struck amazed when I first saw the land the campsite was in, as I sat in the motor boat, sitting in the front. I had the best view, and I loved the view. It was fall, and there were the trees of all the autumn’s colour. The campsite didn’t look as though the people who built the camp cleaned out all the trees, or plants in a specific place, in order to build the site. The cabins were very well hidden in a way; the cabins were built separately in the middle of the nature’s environment. The buildings and the cabins were built here and there, close enough but not packed together. As a result I do not think many trees were had to be cut down to make room for the camp buildings.
I noticed that all the cabins and the buildings were built by wood. The people who built the site used the trees they have cut down to make cabins with it. I see this as a positive influence because, they are using nature’s helps to build a campsite for people to enjoy in. Like us! In a place like Algonquin Park, where the whole environment is not touched by humans greatly, I think it is very important for humans not to ruin it. We already ruined too much of our nature’s environment, we should save as much as we can before they run out. Of course it’ll take a lot of long time for us to consume all the Earth’s resources, but it does not mean its everlasting.

There were many boats in the Tamakwa camp. Conventions such as canoes are a wonderful thing. They do not use any fuels or energy. It is just run by our hands completely. And the elements of course. Canoes are not only saving our energy, it’s fun! I also saw many fuel oils cans in the little building which held the boats. If any of those oils get spilled on the water, it could be quite a pollution. I didn’t see any fishes in the water which I found interesting. Also the whole land was large, so small pollution, such as campfire or the gases coming out of the kitchen chimney, did not really seem as “pollutions.” In such a beautiful large land, such pollutions do not do any harm the environment greatly.

I was not fortunate enough to see any animals in Tamakwa campsite. I only saw rats and chipmunks and squirrels. Such animals like deers, wolves, moose, or bears are shy animals in small numbers so I couldn’t see any animals like those. Although that enough could tell me something. Years and years of the camp taking place in the environment, with people starting fires, making noises, may have made the animals be aware of the space we are in. So the construction of the camp and its surrounding infrastructure have made the animals not come near the campsite, and the camp have already ruined many homes of the animals, whose homes were the trees we cut down. I’m glad that this has prevented wolves from coming near, but because of the camp just being there, animals have lost their homes, and they have lost a territory in their whole environment.

In conclusion, the camp has not affected the natural environment in a huge basis. This does not mean it has done no harm or made any differences in the natural environment. They have, and they have cut down trees, ect.  The camps have affected the natural environment, but have made the succession of trying not to make too much differences or difficulties in the environment. It has affected to the extent where it could stay where it is, and already is a part of the environment, because it has been there for so long, and because the people who made the whole site tried their best not to destroy the natural environment.
