>I already wrote about the work I did while I was a UI/UX Designer at RBC, but I wanted to write a more personal piece about everything I learned from working at RBC, and the corporate world.



#We were tasked to develop a technology-based solution that helps prepare youth for the future of work.
Under the RBC's Corporate Citizenship, [Future Launch](https://www.rbc.com/dms/enterprise/futurelaunch/about.html) represents RBC’s largest ever commitment to a social issue. With the funding of half a billion dollars, the goal is to help Canadian youth aged 15-29 struggling for opportunities to find employment and elevate the Canadian economy. 


#"Find a democratic solution that gives equal access and opportunity." 
This was the answer to my question "So am I allowed to care about the minority representation?". This served as the foundation in which our project would be built on. We had 4 months to research, ideate, prototype, iterate and pitch our solution to key executive stakeholders of the organization.

#The Chatbot that works to close the gap between you and your future job.
As the UI/UX Design and Research Lead, I was tasked with designing the co-design sessions for gathering user experience data about young people's struggles and major pain points in seeking employment. We conducted semi-structured interviews with young people and followed with a collaborate co-design session that aimed to extrat the user's stories. 

We created personas and tested out assumptions that validated Lack of Experience and Uncertainty as main culprits for pain points. We matched these primary data sets with secondary research by investigating the current products and services that help the youth find employment through a Competitive Analysis (also known as environmental scans, horizon scans or market intelligence).

<p class="photo-grid-subtitle">Competitive Analysis of products and services that aims to help youth acheive employment</p>

#Young people are worried about their lack of experience & uncertainty about the "right" job

Based on our reserach, I divided the job seeking process by stages Experience, Self-Discover, Market Yourself and Apply. By scanning the existing solutions out there we were able to find that there was an area in the user's journey that needed improvement: Self-Discover. 
Thus Lumii was designed to help youth self-discover their past experiences and help market them for a successful future.

At the end of our project we pitched our solution to key stakeholders, and our product was incorporated into Future's Launch's 10 year plan to invigorate the Canadian economy by supporting the youth talent.

Amplify is an intensive co-op program that encourages students working in teams of four to solve some of RBC's most complex business challenges.

Amplify is an intensive co-op program that encourages students working in teams of four to solve some of RBC’s most complex business challenges. Whether it’s creating a new way to prevent fraud or changing the game when it comes to everyday banking, the Amplify teams have got it covered. After the successes of last year Amplify 2017 is back and bigger than ever for another summer! This time RBC Amplify has crossed borders, with sixteen teams spanning across the globe. Thirteen of the sixteen Amplify teams will call downtown Toronto their home base for the summer, working in a collaborative space that will allow for the creative freedom required to complete such large-scale projects.  The other three teams can be found in Jersey City, Minneapolis and Luxembourg.

Design thinking and Lean Startup methodology instills a customer focused approach with lots of testing and constant iteration. For many people who are first becoming familiar with these processes it can feel counter intuitive.  Typically, human nature tells us to jump right into solving problems the minute we are given the go-ahead.  When employing design thinking a degree of patience is required, as you must begin by digging below a topic’s surface to determine an appropriate course of action before diving into the solution. The teams were reminded of this from day one when they were presented with sticky notes and white boards to begin their brainstorming process as opposed to laptops and software. (This is not only because



The current situation: Youth face challenges in today’s workplace experience market. Entry-level jobs and experience is crucial for young workers and recent grads. However, these are the very jobs that are diminishing and in danger of disappearing by automation. Youth are in the high-risk job categories that are in danger of being replaced by automation. It makes sense, you employee the least experienced, lowest rate of paid workers to do the most mundane work. 
We know human decision making will be incomparably important in the future when most of our daily activities are automated. And youth are not getting the chance to develop their decision making, but rather mundane tasks. (For me, what I think is important, is giving young employees opportunities to practice their decision-making skills. Human decision making thinking process, are invaluable skills that cannot be replaced by robots or machines, one which will be invaluable for preparing them for their future roles as leaders)
The world we live in are changing, and has been changing: Disruptive Technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning will completely change our workplace and talent allocations. We are looking at a shift in the skill sets in the labor market. 
These Disruptive Technology, however, is also the birthplace of job opportunities, especially for young people. In 2015, over 860,000 Canadians were employed in the Canadian Tech sector.
A recent report by the Brookfield Institute for Innovation + Entrepreneurship (BII+E) estimated that 42 percent of the Canadian labour force is at a high risk of being affected by automation in the next 10 to 20 years. 
Personally speaking also, what is important to me is the secondary barriers these collective youth workers face. Members of visible minority, for example, face more unemployment rates. Young girls also face barriers, where they are underrepresented in these technological fields and education.
Racial dichotomies are something that I am passionate about. In the tech sector, Aboriginals, Hispanic and Black students are underrepresented, and female students of those racial backgrounds are even more underrepresented by their double minorities in the field. 

At the end of the day, investing in the youth, is not just a feel good community charity. It is a long-terming thinking, cost-saving, and indeed exponential potentiality that will ensure Canada will lead the world into global economy as a tech giant. I dare say, all of us are affected by this topic. We are all young workers ourselves, or we are parents with children, or we are colleagues who will no doubt end up working with more millennials, with more generation z. This is a project that requires every corner of the government in Canada to stand up and work together on. From private sectors to non-private, to public to the start ups. We need to increase digital literacy. We need to encourage youth entrepreneurship. We need to teach decision-making skills. And we need to work with data to further convince and provide evidence for the need for youth to succeed, for all of us at the end of the day. And a bonus! It’s a project with a moral compass embedded in it. You are giving back, to the community. You are making the road better for the next generation, which in a deep sense is part of being a member of humanity.  

I had a conversation with some UXD students and professor Olivier St. Cyr this year, who is the head of the UXD Department at my faculty. We discussed the impact of machine learning and AI and the real limitations and the length these technologies have the potential to change our lives in the future. We talked about everything, from scarcity in jobs in manual labour, how technologies will change manual labour, how self driving cars will completely change the transportation industry, and taxis, and busses, and all trucks delivering the consumables we need on a daily basis. We talked about the sustainability of the 1% having most of the world’s wealth, and how countries like America and Canada and Europe that supports this capitalism, is not sustainable. It was an enlightening but also a scary talk, talking about potential revolutions and disruptive changes that we could foresee in the future.

We are trying to develop a 10-year solution to helping the Canadian youth (aged 15-29) prepare for the changing workforce. Our project primarily focuses on teaching/equipping the youth with the skills that will make them successful.
But we have to develop a product that does that and we are still brainstorming for ideas!
